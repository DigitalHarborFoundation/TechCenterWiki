####Software####
#####Thingiverse#####
[Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com) is a website where 3D designers can share designs.  You should definitely create an account and browse the site for interesting designs.  You can "collect" or "favorite" designs that you like.  A `collection` is a group of designs that you put together.  For instance, you might create a collection of [Printrbot Parts]() or a collection for [Toys]().  I've even created collections for just things [I want to print]().

#####TinkerCad#####
[TinkerCad](http://www.tinkercad.com) is currently my favorite recommendation for a beginning 3D design tool.  It allows you to use a web browser to create 3D designs.  Your designs are stored on their site so you can access your designs anywhere and you can also share them with friends.  The designs can also be downloaded to print on a 3D printer or shared out to [Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com).  

[TinkerCad](http://www.tinkercad.com) has a great series of interactive tutorials that walk you through how to use their tool.  The tutorials are some of the best I've seen.

#####OpenScad#####
[OpenScad](http://www.openscad.org) is a free tool for creating [CAD]() designs that can then be 3D Printed.  The tool uses a series of commands that are typed into a script and then the a preview of the image is shown.  Students who have had experience with programming will most likely love OpenScad but even students without programming experience may appreciate the control that typing commands offers rather than using a mouse to drag and drop objects.
